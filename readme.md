The CDM repository shall host the Conceptual Data Model.
The Conceptual Data Model is a product of [Europe's Rail MOTIONAL Project](https://projects.rail-research.europa.eu/eurail-fp1/).
The CDM is hosted here, awaiting a possible setup of repositories under Europe's Rail.

The CDM repository mostly links into other repositories that are public by default; some of them may result in being private (e.g. for hosting non-public data for testing purposes).
The CDM repository wiki will be populated in due time, mostly for guidance of non-participants.

[[About the CDM, its history, and rationale, see the Wiki.|https://github.com/UICrail/CDM/wiki/CDM-Home-Page]]

Currently, following repositories are available:
* [SemanticRSM](https://github.com/UICrail/SemanticRSM), which currently includes infrastructure topology and geometry, as well as rolling stock elements. Other RSM areas will be added later, as packages are rewritten in RDF/OWL.
* [CDM-IFC](https://github.com/UICrail/CDM-IFC), providing backgrounds regarding [IFC](https://www.buildingsmart.org/standards/bsi-standards/industry-foundation-classes/) (Industry Foundation Classes), by [buildingSMART International](https://www.buildingsmart.org/), and their usage in the CDM.

In addition, ongoing tasks are summed up under the (non-public) [MOTIONAL "project"](https://github.com/orgs/UICrail/projects/3) (in the sense of Github).
